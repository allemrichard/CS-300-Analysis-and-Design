**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

For this course, we were given a task to create pseudocodes that inputs/reads a file with the Computer Science courses, sort them, and the user given options to either search for a course, print the information of the course, or print all the courses. The pseudocodes were using different data structures- vector, Hash Table, and BST. In addition, we had to analyze the advantages/disadvantages and timing of using each data structure to complete the problem, and then make a recommendation based on those Big-O notation analysis. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by reading the whole assignment prompt first, and then breaking it down step-by-step making sure I complete each prompt fully. In order to fully complete the prompt, I had to make sure I understood the data structures and what the algorithm is doing as it goes through each line of code because it can be applied in any problem, no matter how large or little the data. In addition, understanding and knowing the advantages/disadvantages and timing analysis of each data structure set up improves how well the code runs. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I overcame roadblocks by refering back to my notes, watching videos on the topic I was working on, utilizing all the resources provided in the Resources section, and reaching out to my instructor for help. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

Throughout this course, it definitely improved and expanded my understanding and knowledge with designing and developing a program. It helped me understand Linked list and Nodes better than before, and also introduced new components, like "Struct" or how a vector or array can hold a data structure with multiple types of information other than just a single piece of information. In addition, it is improving my ability to break down a problem, plan, and write the code. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

It kept with OOP, and held standard practice expectations with comments and naming for better understanding and readability. In addition, with how the program is set up, it can be adapted to take in a different set or size of classes for a different college major, or it can also be adapted to take in different types of values.
